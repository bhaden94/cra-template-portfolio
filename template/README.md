    ### Navigation
    * File: NabObjects.tsx
    * By default all of the navigational items available are there.
    * You may remove any section you do not want.
    * The order you put the objects in will be the order they appear in the navbar and throughout the page.
    * Properties:
        * `text`: What appears in the sections headers and in the sidebar. You may change this to whatever you want, but **do not change the section property to match**.
        * `icon`: The icon that appears in the navbar
        * `section`: **Should not be modified and should stay with the respective section**
